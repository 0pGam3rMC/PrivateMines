PrivateMines allows your players to make private mines similar to a prison server.

<dl>
    <dt>FastAsyncWorldEdit</dt>
    <dd>FAWE is used to fill the mine blocks in a quicker fashion
        without causing any stress on the server</dd>
    <dt>WorldGuard</dt>
    <dd>WorldGuard is used to create the regions in and around
        the private mines to allow for players to mine in the
        mines and it also allows for custom enchantment plugins
        to work alongside PrivateMines
    </dd>
    <dt>Citizens</dt>
    <dd>
    Citizens recommended plugin because it allows for NPC's of the
    Private Mine owners to be created within the mines and then
    players mining within the Private Mines can then sell their blocks
    </dd>
    <dt>AutoSell</dt>
    AutoSell is currently a required plugin for the players to sell
    their items but we're working on a way for the players to sell their
    blocks by using our internal shop system that'll then give
    players a way to change prices of the blocks in their
    own mine.

  <li>Players can change the block of their mine with changeable options in the config</li>
  <li>Players can open their mine to other players, and set a tax for all AutoSelling done while in the mine</li>
  <li>Customise the mine schematic, the world, spawnpoints, messages, and more!</li>
  <li>Every mine gets an NPC that users can right click on to AutoSell their items</li>
  <li>Fully customisable GUIs!</li>
  <li>Full WorldGuard support - every mine has 2 protected regions automatically generated!</li>
  <li>Upgradable mines as seen on popular servers!</li>

You can change the default schematic by going into the schematics.yml and adding a new schematic under the Schematics section.
